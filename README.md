# Introduction
Welcome to my rewrite of (Chutes and Ladders)[https://github.com/RedOctober117/ChutesAndLadders] in rust. The goal of this rewrite is to create a more cohesive OOP iteration that can allow for custom game rules with a proper API.

## Rewrite Ideas
The following:
 - Dynamic board size
 - Custom chute and ladder coords via collection
 - Custom win conditions
 - Custom dice and reroll conditions
 - Improved UI
 - Dynamic perspective switching with game pieces (ie. zoom in on a given square, see the players game piece rather than their initial like board view)
 - Color coded board
 -
